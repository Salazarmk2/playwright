possible directions:
1.
to make it dynamic it requires 3 user input email password and invoice N.O 
then it needs to be abl to login using those credentials allowing any account to be used
then uses inputed invoice number to look up posed invoice memo
needs to be able to pick the first search item of the search result and click it
needs to read the page source to get the desired item total inc,and posted invoice n.O
navigate to posted invoice number and send retrieved P.n.o to the search bar and perform the required actions
print the results and determine the error through logic programmed into the system 
e.g test for error by checking if numbers match,if they exist,if post exists e.t.c

2.
use an llm powered by selenium to scrape website according to parameters
limited information requires further testing if it can navigate through the BC or requires machine learning to make it more dynamic
though it has worked on simpler structured website bc isnt a simple structured website requiring web crawler to be specialised
